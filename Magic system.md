# Magic system

[SpellGuidelines.md](./SpellGuidelines.md)

## Spells

Every spell, even when casting spontaneously, has a Level that can be called a Magnitude.

A spell’s basic effect sets its minimum Level (typically for a spell that is instantaneous and only affects the caster).

- Each increase in **Range**, **Duration**, or **Targets** generally increases the Magnitude by +1
- Some spell effects may have additional math that increases the Level of the base effect (e.g., Terram has a multiplier for affecting metals instead of dirt/soil).

While there are many mathematical permutations possible with the system, the central rule of spell creation is that the GM and group are not compelled to accept a Level that seems too high or low for what the spell is accomplishing. Use your best judgement rather than attempting to find a corner case that is more effective than other spells of the same level.

## Range, Duration, and Targets

Each of the variables below are listed with the number they add to Magnitude.

### Range

Range is based on the position of the nearest part of the caster relative to the nearest part of the target (e.g., a mage can cast a Touch range spell on an entire room and those in it by touching a talisman to the wall of the room).

For longer durations, the caster does not have to remain in range. However, if the caster can control the effect after casting it, she must be within the original range to exert control (and may lose control upon moving out of range then regain it when returning to the range).

#### Personal (+0)

The spell only affects the caster and her carried/worn possessions (and the target will always be Individual).

#### Touch (+1)

The spell only affects the caster or a touched target.

#### Eye (+1)

The spell affects any person or creature with whom the caster establishes eye contact. This is automatic for unwary individuals in a social setting. For wary and unwilling targets, it’s impossible to make eye contact without at least two people holding the target down. It’s generally impossible in combat. It typically takes a combat round to establish eye contact with a calm animal.

#### Voice (+2)

The spell affects a target within range of the caster’s voice. This is generally 15 paces for normal casting volume, or up to 50 for a shout. Casting quietly reduces the range, but magical voice enhancement doesn’t increase it. The range is based on the distance the voice carries, not whether the target can hear it. The range is established upon initial casting, so the caster can vary the volume of her voice after casting without changing the range. (Independent items must be given a voice with Creo Imaginem to use this range.)

#### Road (+2; Faerie Magic only)

The spell can target anyone or anything on the same road or path as the caster. Visibility to the target is not generally required as long as the caster is aware of the target in some way (or is using Intellego to search for something). Individuals must be within the edges of the path, and structures must have a primary access onto the road.

#### Sight (+3)

The spell can target anything the caster can see, even if enhanced by a high vantage point. The mage must be able to see to use this range. (Independent items must be given sight with Intellego Imaginem to use this range.)

#### Arcane Connection (+4)

The spell can target anything to which the caster has an Arcane Connection (see page 84), usually regardless of actual distance.

### Duration

Effects that make sense at a Momentary duration that are given a longer one typically undo their effect at the end of the duration rather than having their effect multiple times, unless the physical properties of the effect make sense (e.g., a wound healed with a non-Momentary duration returns at the end of the duration, while a fire created with a longer duration burns things as a fire would as long as it lasts). Perdo effects with a duration continue to destroy any new qualifying materials while the duration lasts (e.g., if you use Perdo Terram to create a pit, any new earth used to fill it is also destroyed, but other matter may not be).

#### Momentary (+0)

The spell has its effect and then dissipates (but any logical consequences of it persist). Creo spells may have this duration to permanently create something (or heal a wound) only if they are cast a ritual (and, thus, consume vis).

#### Concentration (+1)

The spell expires as soon as the caster loses concentration (usually maximum 15 minutes per point of the Concentration ability, and also see page 82 for rules on distractions).

#### Diameter/Scene (+1)

The spell expires after a scene or about two minutes .

#### Sun (+2)

The spell expires at the next sunrise or sunset (whichever occurs first).

#### Ring (+2)

The spell expires once the target leaves an inscribed ring (or the ring is broken, for spells that prevent targets from entering the ring). The caster must trace the ring while casting (even if it’s permanently inscribed) at a rate of 10 paces per round. For large rings, the caster may need to maintain concentration or risk botching (see page 112).

#### Moon (+3)

The spell expires after both the new and full moon have set once.

#### Fire (+3; Faerie Magic only)

The spell can only be cast with a fire as the target, and expires when the fire does (which can be a very long time for a well-tended fire). Because the target is a fire, this only works with the Ignem and Imaginem forms.

#### Year (+4)

The spell expires upon sunrise of the fourth solstice/equinox after its casting (i.e., it could last as few as 9 months if cast immediately before a solstice/equinox, and only a full year if cast immediately after sunrise on a solstice/equinox). It must be cast as a ritual.

#### Year and a Day (+4; Faerie Magic only)

The spell expires after a full year and one more day (rather than being governed by the turning of the seasons). It must be cast as a ritual.

#### Until (+4; Faerie Magic only)

The spell expires only when the condition is met. This spell must be cast as a ritual. The spell cannot usually be dispelled without meeting the condition. The condition must be specified when the spell is cast, and the spell also expires if the caster passes into Twilight (even temporarily) or the caster or target dies.

#### Bargain (Special; Faerie Magic only)

Calculate all other effects normally (including how long the spell will last if the Bargain is broken). Increase the Magnitude of the spell by +3, but double the final Penetration of the spell. The bargain remains in effect for a Year duration: if the target breaks the terms of the Bargain before the end of the year, the spell immediately takes effect without having to bypass resistance.

### Target

Targets are generally based on being a whole thing, rather than a given size (e.g., a pebble and a menhir are both an Individual stone). However, each form has a size for an assumed target, and affecting something much larger requires increasing the spell’s Magnitude (by +1 per x10 increase in mass). See the sidebar on page 113 for specifics.

#### Individual (+0)

The spell targets a single discrete thing (usually meaning it can be relatively easy separated from a group/whole). Adornments of an Individual are generally part of that Individual (e.g., clothes on a person, moss on a boulder, etc.).

#### Circle (+0)

The spell targets everything within an inscribed circle at the time of casting, with the same limitations as the Ring duration (and usually spells with this target are given that duration). If not cast with the Ring duration, the spell still expires early if the circle is broken.

#### Part (+1)

The spell targets a part of a greater whole (i.e., they cannot be easily separated from the group/whole, such as a limb or rock that is still part of the mountain). This is meant for spatial, rather than conceptual parts (e.g., your mind is not a part, but your heart is).

#### Group (+2)

The spell targets a group of people/things that are close together spatially and separated from things of the same type (e.g., you cannot easily single out multiple individuals within a crowd without affecting the whole crowd). After casting, the targets remain affected for the duration even if they move apart, and new members of the group that join after casting aren’t affected. This target option is likely to be affected by the size rules if the group is large.

#### Room (+2)

The spell targets everything within a defined room (enclosed with definite boundaries separating it from other rooms and/or the outside; a courtyard and cave may count, but a valley doesn’t).

#### Structure (+3)

The spell targets everything within a single structure, which can be composed of multiple rooms, up to the outer edge of the structure’s walls. In general, a single structure may vary in size, but must generally have one roof.

#### Bloodline (+3; Faerie Magic only)

The spell effects the immediate target (who must be in range) and all people descended by blood from the target. It applies to any members of the bloodline currently existing or born within its duration. Every individual gets magic resistance, if applicable. It may be possible to design the spell to avoid Warping the targets.

#### Boundary (+4)

The spell targets everything within a well-defined natural or man-made geographic boundary. This can include walls of a city, edges of a village, shores of a lake, edge of a forest, or base of a mountain. There must be an actual boundary, rather than just affecting a very large area. It must be cast as a ritual.

## Requisites

Spells that create effects that cross beyond the boundaries of a single Technique or Form include a Requisite: one or more additional arts necessary for the spell. When casting the spell, your total is composed of the lowest scores of the same type of art (e.g., if the spell involves a Form requisite, the lower of the two Forms is used, but the Technique is used no matter its value). However, other systems effects (such as Magic Resistance) are based on the primary Technique and Form, even if your total is based on a lower Requisite.

Spells involving a Requisite may be a higher level than the effect would normally indicate, when the combination of multiple arts allows a more powerful effect than either art alone.

Some spells include a Casting Requisite, which allows you to choose from different arts when you cast the spell to achieve different effects. They still function like fixed Requisites for determining
