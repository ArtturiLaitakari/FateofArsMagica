# Sample quests

## 1. Rapunzel

Giovanni Grimaldi gets a perfume deal if he saves his cousin Doucelle. Marco Polo immediately volunteers to save her, as his powers are very fit for a hit and resque mission.

Sadly they cannot find her, until Anders suggests that what if she is in fairy region. So a search party is formed to travel to capricious fairyland where a tall tower is found.

**Twist:**

Doucelle, a girl with fairy blood, is pregnant to a fairy prince. Should she stay, she could marry a fairy prince and have a royal family. But this botches a perfume deal and angers Giovanni's family.

As a group, the pack has scale when dealing with lone targets. The hellhound may check a box to absorb up to 2 shifts in damage, representing individual hounds being taken out or driven away.

  If able to communicate with her hell-hounds, the Leanansidhe may give them orders. They then check boxes of Obedience according to their stunts to aid themselves in obeying these orders. Recover this condition when the hounds are able to spend time resting in the company of the Leanansidhe.

### STUNTS

- **Group Tactics**:  
  Hell-hounds are most effective in large packs. For every unchecked box of Dwindling Numbers, add +1 to any Tracking Prey roll.

  Crone’s power grows with the harsh winter. As long as this condition has unchecked boxes, Crone is empowered by Winter’s full strength. She may invoke this condition to deal additional damage with ice and frost-based powers or increase her resistance to magical attacks. This condition is recovered when Crone rests in the heart of Winter’s realm, the icy depths of her domain, or when her powers are replenished by the Winter Court.

- **Winter’s Command**:

### LOUP-GAROU

#### ASPECTS

- **High Concept:** Rampaging Wolf-like Demon  
- **Other Aspects:** Fearsome Teeth and Mighty Claws  

#### APPROACHES

- **Good (+3):** Force  
- **Average (+1):** Focus, Guile  
- Special: **Rage (+4)**, blind rage attacks

#### STRESS & CONDITIONS

- **Stress:** [] [] [] [] [] []  
- **Physical Immunity (special):** [x] This condition starts checked. The loup-garou does not take damage and cannot be taken out for any reason save with penetrating attacks forged in inherited silver, which deal damage as normal.  
- **Blood-lust (special):** [x] This condition is always checked. The loup-garou is driven to kill, cannot resist those instincts, and actively hunts human targets for slaughter. If mortals are near, it may prioritize which one to pursue but it must go on the attack.  
- **Frenzied (sticky):** [ ] Mark this condition if the loup-garou is attacked; this condition absorbs any damage from the attack if it bypasses the creature’s Physical Immunity. The demon is then enraged, more powerful but less controllable, and gains a new approach, Rage, at Great (+4). It cannot, however, sensibly prioritize targets, attacks the nearest target of which it is aware, and does nothing beyond attack or pursue until that target is dead or the loup-garou is unable to continue its pursuit, at which point it moves on to its next victim. Recover this condition when no one remains for the loup-garou to target.  

### STUNTS

- **Out of Nowhere:** Once per session, the loup-garou may burst through a window or wall into any scene that occurs during a full moon. Frenzied is automatically checked.

3. The Innocent man

Judge of Cagne Sur Mer has found a man guilty of murder. By a coincidence Anders Wirtzenius is there and read his mind, revealing that he actually was a witness to a murder, but all the evidence points at him.

- He cannot reveal he is a mage, and magic is not evidence in court
- The real murderer is a vampire noble, something you cannot just say as officially vampires do not exist.
- Anders must find mundane evidence of the real killer

### Three trials

- Blood that don't spill
- Secret of the locked room
- The trial

### 3. Baron Vittorio della Rosé

According to peace treaty, vampires are not allowed to live in area owned/managed by Hermetic mages, and hermetic mages are not allowed to live in an area owned/managed by vampires.

Marco polo and companions go to baron to announce his expulsion from barony, as a hermetic mage now manages it.
