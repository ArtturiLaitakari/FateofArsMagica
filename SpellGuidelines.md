# Spell guidelines

# ANIMAL (An)

To tell if a spell affects the mind of a creature, determine from the animal's Characteristics if it has Cunning or Intelligence. If the creature has Intelligence, a Mentem spell must be used;
if it has Cunning an Animal spell must be used. If a Creature with Intelligence is shape-changed into animal form, a Mentem spell must be used, instead its body is affected by Animal spells.
If a human body has animal parts (e.g. wings), only those parts are affected by Animal spells.
A Bjornaer magus in animal form is truly an animal, and so is affected in mind and body by Animal, however spells with continuing effect cast on one form continue to affect the other.
A basic Individual for Animal is an animal of about the same size as a pony, Size +1, or lower.

## Creo Animal (CrAn)

When creating a magical creature, the Magical Might of the creature cannot exceed the level of the spell, and requisites must be included for any special powers.
A Vim requisite, for the magical nature, is always required. To create treated animal products add one magnitude to the level necessary to create the equivalent amount of dead animal.
To create treated and processed animal products, add two magnitude o the level necessary to create the equivalent amount of dead animal.To influence the beauvoir of created animals,
a Rego requisite is required and as his is an additional effect add at least one magnitude to the spell level. Otherwise they just do what comes naturally.

Part: a part of an Individual. This category applies easily.

# AURAM (Au)

Auram spells usually affects air phenomena, like winds, odors …, rather than gases, which is a modern concept. Some target categories for Auram requires some clarification;
if the normal descriptions apply, they can, of course, be used.
Individual: a single phenomenon, such as one wind, one cloud, one bolt of lightning.
Group: several related phenomenon, such as the clouds, winds, and rain in a storm.
A base Individual for Auram is a weather phenomenon that affects the area within a standard Boundary – an area 100 paces across.

## Creo Auram (CrAu)

Weather phenomena are normally created at Sight range. This is because most weather phenomena naturally begin in the upper air, and so spells to create weather must have enough Range to reach this area.
It is possible to create weather phenomena that start at the ground, but they are very unnatural, and the increase in level for that precisely offset the decrease from reducing Range to Touch.
A flying magus could, of course, use Touch range to create natural weather phenomena, but such spells are not very popular in the Order.

# CORPUS (Co)

A base Individual for Corpus is an adult human being up to Size +1. The physical Characteristics are Strength, Stamina, Dexterity and Quickness, and they can be affected and improved by Corpus magic.

## Creo Corpus (CrCo)

Many Creo Corpus spells are most useful as ritual spells. Unless otherwise noted, a healing spell cast other than as a momentary duration ritual actually suspends the healing process so that upon the spell's expiration, wound are as fresh as they were when the spell was cast.
No Hermetic spell can restore Fatigue levels. A spell that can heal something can also heal less serious versions of the same thing (a spell that can heal Medium Wounds can also heal Light Wounds).
However, a spell to heal wounds cannot cure diseases, no matter how high its level, and vice versa.
**Note:** There are clarifications and revisions of the core Corpus guidelines and spells on page 57 of Art & Academe.

**Abysmal (-3):** Give an character a +1 bonus to Recovery rolls.

## Muto Corpus (MuCo)

Transformation do not usually eradicate the original form, something of the original must remain (turning a fat lame man in a wolf originate a fat lame male wolf).
Transformation can have subtle, and sometimes dramatic, permanent effect. Someone who spent a month or more as an animal begins to act and think like that animal.
Eventually weak willed individuals might lose their human identity altogether.
When transformed back in human, the target might temporarily or permanently retain some feature of the other shape. Transformation are tricky things.
Muto Corpus spells cannot alter person's mind, so they leave the transformed person's intelligence and knowledge intact. Magi can cast spell while in animal form, but suffer the normal -2 penalty for casting without hands and voice. The transformed person gains any abilities the animal form has though it may take a day or so of experience to get used to using them.
To change accouterments along with the body involves requisites (Animal for the leather armor and so on). Accouterments are transformed only if they are actually being worn, not if they are just carried in the hand, or if the story guide rules that the equipment is not sufficiently part of the target's worn equipment. This untransformed equipment falls to the ground.
When you are under the influence of one your shape-changing spells, you may change yourself back by concentrating, but doing so ends the spells.
While concentrating, you symbolically remove some item to break the spell (a wolfskin cloak, some water in your hands):
this foci are essential if you are able to break the spell in this way. If you cast a spell without them, you must dispel the magic with Perdo Vim, or wait the duration expire.

# IMAGINEM (Im)

Imaginem is the Form of sensation and illusion, thus one can creates, perceives, transforms, destroys, and controls images, not necessarily illusions. Imaginem cannot affect light, as this is part of Ignem,
but it can affect the things that light allows you to see. Stenches and perfumes, tints and stains, color and shadow, melody and cacophony, sweet and sour,
all these are perceptions, and so can be manipulated by the Art of Imaginem.
An image works on the senses, not on the mind, so an unthinking beast is as likely to believe an image as an imaginative human.
Similarly, everyone can sense an illusion create by Imaginem magic. Nevertheless, Imaginem spells are still most effective at fouling the communication on which human society depends.
Beasts are likely to be fooled by illusions, as are the simpler undead.
Demons are very hard to deceive, while faeries often see through illusions and manipulate them to fool you in turn.
Certain member of the Church have proven remarkably adept at discerning truth from illusion though the talent is not dependable.
It's more difficult to mimic a specific object or person using an Imaginem spell than is to mimic a general image, and requires a Perception + Finesse stress roll: the higher roll, the better you can fool people.
You get a a bonus to your roll for familiarity with what you are mimicking (-3 for an unfamiliar object, +3 for highly familiar object or for having the subject available for modelling).
For mimicking people, a roll of 6+ lets you fool acquaintances of the person, 9+lets fool your friends, and 12+ lets you fool close friends and relatives. Use a similar scale for mimicking objects.
If you botch the Finesse roll, you may think the image is satisfactory, but it's immediately seen through once in use.
A base Individual of Imaginem is the equivalent of an adult human being; whether a visual image of about that size, an auditory illusion making that much noise, or whether.

**Note:** There are clarifications of the core Imaginem guidelines on pages 61-66 of Houses of Hermes: Societates.

## Creo Imaginem (CrIm)

It is importation to note that Creo Imaginem only create the images of things, not the thing them self. This is the first (and most important) clue that image is just an illusion.
On the other hand, the illusion of a wall may feel solid, but will present no resistance if someone pushes an hand through it. Increasing the complexity of a sensory perception, such as making a moving visual image or
making clear words instead of noise, adds an additional level of magnitude. Making an image or make noise at your direction as you concentrate add two level of magnitude.
In addition a very intricate images (an intricately ornate bridge) are generally one level of magnitude higher as well.

**Abysmal (-3):** Create an image that affects a single sense.

**Terrible (-2):** Create an image that affects two senses.

**Poor (-1):** Create an image that affects three senses.

**Mediocre (+0):** Create an image that affects four senses.

**Average (+1):** Create an image that affects five senses.

## Intellego Imaginem (InIm)

These spells improve upon your senses by bringing in images, usually sounds and images, not normally available. Note that seeing or hearing into another room or
a hundred miles away does you no good if there is no light or sound there. As in CrIm spells, each additional sense you wish to perceive increases the level of the spell by one magnitude.

**General:** Discern an illusion caused by spells of equal or lower level than the level of this spell (Vision target).

**Abysmal (-3):** Use one sense at a distance.
-  Memorize or perfect your memory about an image you have encountered.

-  Sense a supernatural creature of Might 50 or above with a Might associated with Imaginem.p.111

**Terrible (-2):** Use two senses at a distance.
-  Sense a supernatural creature of Might 40 or above with a Might associated with Imaginem.p.111

**Terrible (-2):** Change two sensations of an object.

**Poor (-1):** Change three sensations of an object.

**Mediocre (+0):** Change four sensations of an object.

**Average (+1):** Change five sensations of an object.

## Perdo Imaginem (PeIm)

Destroying changing images is more difficult – add one level of magnitude to the spell that do so. Note also that shadow are due to the physical body blocking the light,
thus destroying something's shadow is Creo Ignem, or possibly Rego Ignem, and not Perdo Imaginem. Mirror images, however, are cause to the species bouncing off the mirror, so a spell destroying
(or changing) the species also changes mirror images.

**Terrible (-2):** Destroy an object ability to affect taste or touch.

## Rego Imaginem (ReIm)

As with CrIm and PeIm, it is slightly harder to affects changing images.

# MENTEM (Me)

Intelligent minds are affected by Mentem spells while the minds of beasts are affected only by Animal spells. The mental Characteristics are Intelligence, Perception, Presence, and Communication.,
and they can be affected by Mentem spells. Minds do not have a size, so size modifiers do not apply to Mentem effects with individual targets.
However, minds can be counted, so for Groups you still need to boost the size to affect more people.
Similarly Mentem spells affecting everyone in a Room, Structure, or Boundary have size modifiers in the normal way.
Note: There are clarifications of the core Mentem guidelines on pages 32-34 of Art & Academe.
-  There are clarifications of the core Mentem guidelines on pages 66-70 of Houses of Hermes: Societates.

## Intellego Mentem (InMe)

Additional ideas can be seen in Intellego Animal guidelines, for spell that affects the mind. Note that writing does not contain any information of itself, and is generally materials
Animal, Herbam, or Terram for the materials, not Mentem. To translate writings, you need someone who can read it, although you could read the translation from their mind.
A Momentary Mentem spell can answer a single question, although is not necessary that the answer be expressible in a brief form. Finding out a lot of information takes time

**Abysmal (-3):** Sense a supernatural creature of Might 50 or above with a Might associated with Mentem.p.111

## Muto Mentem (MuMe)

Muto Mentem spells give a mind properties it could naturally acquire.These fall into three main categories.
First, changing memories: while memories may decay over time, they do not naturally change radically, so making them so do is Muto.
Second, emotions and thoughts that people cannot normally feel: this includes the thoughts of an animal and similar.
Third, non mental properties: this cover making a mind physical and is very difficult.
Granting a magical sense to other people has a base level one magnitude higher than granting it to yourself using Intellego.
The necessary increase to range, and possibly, target increase the level further.

## Perdo Mentem (PeMe)

Emotions naturally reappear in a person, so spells that destroy them must have a continuing duration to ensure that they do not come back.
Memories do not naturally return, so Momentary duration spells remove them forever, although a person could be told what he had forgotten,
or reconstruct the memory from things he does remember.
A continuing spell would prevent a person from relearning that information however.

**Poor (-1):** Remove a minor detail from the person's memory.

# TERRAM (Te)

Through Terram spells affect all manner of solid objects, it is harder to affect certain materials.
Here in increasing order of difficulty are the materials: earth (sand, dirt, mud), clay, stone, glass, metal, gemstones.
Each level of difficulty does not necessarily represent an increase in one level of magnitude.
The base Individual for Terram depends on the material involved.
For earth, clay and other similar substances, it is about 10 cubic paces of stuff; for stone it is a single cubic pace; for base metals it is a cubic foot,
while for precious metals it is 1/10 of cubic foot; and for gemstones the base individual is one cubic inch in size.

The target below are for changing earth (dirt, sand, mud…). To change to or from stone or glass, add one level of magnitude.
To change to or from metal or gemstone add two level of magnitudes.
These adjustment only apply only once, so that changing metal to metal is only two magnitudes higher.
The amount of material you can change is limited by the guidelines for each end.
Thus you can turn a cubic pace of stone in a cubic inch of gemstone with a base Individual.

**General:** Convert part of a Terram elemental’s body into another type of Terram matter, reducing the elementals Might Pool by the level of the spell +10.

# VIM (Vi)

Vim spells helps your spell to have a better effects. Many Vim spells are meant to be cast along with other spells, and modify or change their effects.
Vim magic also encompasses summoning and dealing with Demons, but this practice is prohibited within the Order, rather fighting Demons is allowed.
Magi often use Vim spells to counteract magical phenomena: in these case Story guide should assign spell level for all magical phenomena that those using Vim counter spells will have to match.
Most Vim spell are of General level, and the guidelines provided for Vim spell take account of this, and rather than giving an absolute level for a corresponding effect, they give the relationship that the level of the Vim spell must bear to the level of the target.
When you change parameters of a General spell, you should take account of these change in level before multiplying or dividing the the spell's level to get the real effect.
The Individual target for a Vim spell can refer to either an individual spell, or an individual object or person, and similarly for Group.
If a target is a person or an object, the Vim spell will affect any suitable magic affecting that person, not just one spell.
Most such spells can only be cast on either other spells or individuals, but, if the description suggests that they could be cast on either, then they can.
Spells and magical effect do not have sizes, so size modifications do not apply to the levels of Individual Target Vim spells.
However Vim spells affecting areas, or number of spells, must be increased in level for large areas or large numbers, as normal.
The guidelines below refers mainly to spells: this is for the sake of brevity, as Vim spells can affect magical effects, proceeding from magical items, magical creatures, or demons.
However unless specifically stated otherwise, the spells do not affect magical items, only the effects that they produce.
It should be noted that Hermetic magi, and some non-Hermetic wizards, do not have Might score, and thus are not affected by wardings or other spells that act against Might score.

## Creo Vim (CrVi)

**General:** Create a magical shell which looks real to Intellego spells with a level less than twice its level plus one magnitude.
-  This aura is generic “magic” only – no misleading information can be supplied.
-  Create a magical shell which prevents Intellego spells with a level less than its level plus one magnitude from learning any details about the magic on the target.
-  Create a magical shell which gives false information about the target to Intellego spells with level less than half its (level plus one magnitude).
-  Refreshes all spell traces within the target that are less than the magnitude of the guideline -1, in negative magnitude. p.74
-  Restore a demons Might Pool by (the level of the spell + 10), as long as the spell penetrates its Magic Resistance. p.121
-  Potentially strengthen a Magic aura; roll on the Aura Strengthening Table with a modifier equal to magnitude; the modifier must be 0 or greater, thus the minimum possible base level is 4. (Ritual) p.14

**Poor (-1):** Taint something with magic.

**Mediocre (+0):** Create a temporary Arcane Connection to a demon within range.p.121

**Average (+1):** Create a burst of magic that gives the target 1 Warping point.
-  Spell that grant Warping cannot have a duration of greater than Momentary. Note that doing this to a magus is an attack, an clearly against the Code.
-  Decrease the rate of decay of an Arcane Connection as if the connection were one step higher on the table in ArM5, page 84.
If this increases the Duration to Years or greater, the duration of the connection continues to be measured in a period of years.
Hermetic magic can not make an Arcane Connection last indefinitely without fixing the connection as described in ArM5, page 94.
Note that the range is the range to the Arcane Connection, and you must know what you are targeting just like any other spell. [MoH p.113]

**Fair (+2):** Give the target 2 Warping point.
-  Decrease the rate of decay of an Arcane Connection as if the connection were two steps higher on the table in ArM5, page 84, subject to the same limits as the level 5 guideline. [MoH p.113]

**Good (+3):** Give the target 3 Warping point.
-  Decrease the rate of decay of an Arcane Connection as if the connection were three steps higher on the table in ArM5, page 84, subject to the same limits as the level 5 guideline. [MoH p.113]

**Great (+4):** Give the target 4 Warping point.

## Intellego Vim (InVi)

Demons cannot be detected by Intellego spells unless they wish to do (at least to the common knowledge of the Order), because they are the essence of deception, thus there are no demons locating spells in the Order.
Magic items cannot be investigated with simple spells, but requires a season spent in laboratory to discover what magic an enchanted item contains and how to use them (see the Laboratory chapter).
Further increase in level will give increased sensitivity to residues. The base level of a spell also gives a fairly good idea of the strength of a spell (within a magnitude).
In addition of one magnitude will say whether the effect is Hermetic, and a magus familiar with other types of magic will be able to identify them as well.
The addition of two magnitudes will give information about Technique and Form, or nearest equivalent for other type of magic. Further increases in the level will yield further information, depending on the design of the specific spell.
Different spells may be invented to detect Faerie, Divine, or Infernal effects. Each spells affects only one realm, and Story guide may disallow spells that detect the Divine or Infernal.
As general rule, the residues of magic decline as follow: as soon as the magic finishes, the magnitude halves, it then drops by one for one for every duration of the spell that passes.
Story guide should employ this as a guideline, not a rigid formula, and may if they wish, allow high level detection spells to pick up residues with “negative magnitude”.
Magical items can have an effective residue magnitude equal to the number of pawn of vis used to open the enchantment (or the total pawns used for lesser enchanted devices).
Magnitudes for non-Hermetic items must be settled by the Story guide.
A spell that detect items will not also detect effects or creatures, and vice versa. Variants will detect item enchanted by different Realms, as above.
Magical creatures can also be detected: that their Might as the level of the effect; for Hermetic magic use their highest Art. Divide Might (or the Art) by five (rounding up) to get the effective residue magnitude.
Again this requires a different spell and variants may detect Faerie and possibly Divine creatures. Story guide may allow spells that detect other Infernal creatures, such as diabolists and undead.
Raw vis will show up as magical, simply as raw vis, under any magical detection. The level of the detecting spell is irrelevant as is the the realm of power that is was designed to detect.
However, only specially designed spells will yield any information other than that is raw vis.
**General:** Detect the traces of magic of negative magnitude up to the magnitude of the guideline used -2. (+3 magnitudes gives the rough details of the effect and the sigil of the caster.
This level also enables the Quaesitor to tell if a Hermetic effect was created by a spell or invested device.
Quaesitors with extensive experience of a particular sort of non-Hermetic power can also identify that; the limit is the Quaesitors ability to interpret the information provided by the spell.)p.74

**Abysmal (-3):** Detect magic of 10° magnitude or higher
-  Detect the presence of a mystical aura.
-  Detect the presence of raw vis.
-  Sense a supernatural creature of Might 50 or above with a Might associated with Vim.p.111

**Terrible (-2):** Detect magic of 8° magnitude or higher.
-  Determine the power of a mystical aura.
-  Sense a supernatural creature of Might 40 or above with a Might associated with Vim.p.111
-  Count the number of individuals in the spell Target. [TMRE p.93]


**Poor (-1):** Detect magic of 6° magnitude or higher.
-  Detect regio boundaries. If cast with a Vision target, this provides enough information to find a way between levels, for regiones that allow that sort of entrance.
-  Otherwise, it reveals the presence of a regio, and possibly its rough shape.
-  Sense a supernatural creature of Might 30 or above with a Might associated with Vim.p.111
-  Count the number of individuals in the spell Target, divided into apparent categories.[TMRE p.93]

**Mediocre (+0):** Detect magic of 3° magnitude or higher.
-  Judge the amount of vis present.
-  Discern the Art of vis.
-  Discern the alignment of an aura. p.14
-  Sense a supernatural creature of Might 15 or above with a Might associated with Vim.p.111
-  Sort the individuals in the spell Target into categories and count them. [TMRE p.93]

**Average (+1):** Detect any active magic.
-  Speak with a demon. p.121
-  Sense any supernatural creature with a Might associated with Vim. p.111

**Fair (+2):** Detect the traces of powerful magic.
-  Detect the recent presence of weak magic.
-  Detect an active magic and any trace of positive magnitude. p.74
-  Detect the Gift. [HMRE p.6]

## Muto Vim (MuVi)

Most MuVi spells last as long as the spell that they have altered, with a nominal duration of Momentary.
It is not normally possible to have a MuVi spell that lasts longer than the target spell.
These meta-magical spells have certain restrictions, which apply to all MuVi spells invented according to Hermetic theory.
First of all, they cannot be cast on spontaneous spells: such magic is being manipulated at whim – any attempt to alter it further would make the caster lose control.
Second, you must make an Intelligence + Concentration roll of 9+ if you are casting both spells: if this fails, the spells do not go off; if it botches, they botch.
If you wish to cast one of these spells on a spell being cast by another magus you must be either cooperating, or you must fast cast the MuVi spell.
There is no other way to get the timing right. In addition your Penetration total for the MuVi spell must beat the other magus's Penetration total for the spell to be changed, unless you are cooperating.
Touch range is sufficient to affect your own spells, but Voice range at least, is needed to affect another magus's casting. You cannot touch the spell itself.
These spells can only be used on Hermetic magic, as they depends on a good understanding of the process involved.
You may only put a MuVi effect into a magical item if it is to work with another effect in that item. All MuVi spells require some tailoring to the specific use, and a magical item effect cannot be so tailored.
Note that a spell invented according to one of the guidelines below will change another spell in a specific way; it is not possible to invent a single spell which changes another spell however the caster wants.
See the example spells for ideas on how specific this should be. It is not possible to use MuVi to affect another spell after it has been cast.

**General:** Superficially change a spell of less than twice the (level +1 magnitude) of the MuVi spell. This may not change the primary effect of the spell or its power.
-  Significantly change a spell of less than the (level +1 magnitude) of the MuVi spell. This may not change either the Technique or Form of the target spell. A change in power of plus or minus one magnitude is a significant change, as is change of target, if the target was possible for the original spell.
-  Totally change a spell of less than half the (level +1 magnitude) of the MuVi spell.This may change the Technique, Form, or both of the target spell, and needs no requisites for those Arts. The MuVi spell affect the structure of the spell, not the things that the spell targets. A change in power up to two magnitudes is a total change. Any grater change requires either Creo or Perdo to create more magical energy or destroy some.
-  Bind a demon with Might equal to (the level of the spell + 10) to a person or object.p.121

## Perdo Vim (PeVi)

If you want to cast a PeVi spell on a character who has Magic Resistance, you must overcome the Magic Resistance.

**General:** Make something, including a magical item, seem non-magical to any Intellego spell of less than twice the (level –2 magnitudes) of this spell.
-  Dispel effects of a specific type with a level less than the (level +4 magnitudes) of the Vim spell + stress die (no botch). A specific type could be Hermetic Terram magic, or Shamanic spirit control magic.

A magus must have some knowledge of a type of magic although not necessarily ability to use it) to invent a spell to affect it. All Hermetic magi have some knowledge of all Hermetic magic.
-  Reduce the target Might by the level of a spell +10, as long as the spell penetrates the creature's resistance.
-  Dispel any magical effect with a casting total less than half the (level +4 magnitudes) of the Vim spell + a stress die (no botch).
-  Reduce the casting total for all magic cast by the target by half the (level +2 magnitudes) of the spell. If 2 or more spells affect one target, only the highest has any effect: the penalties do not add.
The spell must penetrate the target's Magic Resistance in order to have any effect.

Average (+1): Reduce the duration of an Arcane Connection by one step on the table on page 84. If this reduces the duration below Hours, the connection expires immediately. Does not work on connections that naturally have Indefinite duration, but can make an Arcane Connection that was fixed in laboratory expire. Note that the Range is the range to the Arcane Connection, and you must know what you are targeting, just as for any other spell.

**Fair (+2):** Reduce the duration of an Arcane Connection by 2 steps on the table on page 84, as above.

**Good (+3):** Reduce the duration of an Arcane Connection by 3 steps on the table on page 84, as above.

**Great (+4):** Reduce the duration of an Arcane Connection by 4 steps on the table on page 84, as above.

**Superb (+5):** Reduce the duration of an Arcane Connection by 5 steps on the table on page 84, as above.

**Fantastic (+6):** Reduce the duration of an Arcane Connection by 6 steps on the table on page 84, as above.

## Rego Vim (ReVi)

Theoretically is possible to conjure and control demons through ReVi spells, but this knowledge and its use are forbidden by the Hermetic Code.
Any who find and dare to use this knowledge face dangers from both the beings they deal with and those in the Order of Hermes who strongly object to such practices.
ReVi would able be the combination of Arts that granted Magic Resistance, but not even Bonisagusas able to turn Parma Magica into a spell.
Aegis of the Hearth is the best that has been managed, and that spell is not fully integrated into Hermetic theory.

**General:** Ward the target against creature with a Might less than the level of the spell. A creature warded against cannot directly affect the target physically or by magical means.
A spell of this nature will only ward against creatures of one Realm (Divine, Magic, Faerie or Infernal). (Base Ward Spells Guideline applies)
-  Sustain or suppress a spell you have cast whose level is less than the (level + 2 magnitudes) of the Vim spell.
-  Create a conduit or container for spells with a level lesser than the (level +5 magnitudes) of the Vim spell. A conduit puts you in mystical contact with the target (effective Touch range), while a container will hold a spell for a specific length of time before releasing it.
-  Sustain or suppress a spell cast by another with level less than the half the (level +5 magnitudes) of the Vim spell.
-  Ward against beings associated with Vim from one supernatural realm with Might less than or equal to the level of the spell. (Touch, Ring, Circle) p.114
